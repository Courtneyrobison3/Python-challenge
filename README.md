## PyBank Challenge
In this challenge, we have been tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records for a company. 
We have been given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 
(Thankfully, this company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)
I have created a python script that analyzes the records to calculate the following values. To total number of months in the
dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" 
over the entire period, the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period, and the greatest decrease in losses 
(date and amount) over the entire period.


## Files

results.txt

budget_data.csv

main.py


## Results


Financial Analysis 
---------------------------- 
Total Months: 86

Total: $38382578 

Average  Change: $ -2315.1176470588234

Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)

Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)


## Execution
to execute, main.py needs be in a folder with another called "Resources" which will contain the budget_data.csv file. 
Run main.py  This will create an analysis folder and the results.txt file.
