# Python-challenge

## PyBank Challenge
In this challenge, we have been tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records for a company. 
We have been given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 
(Thankfully, this company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)
I have created a python script that analyzes the records to calculate the following values. To total number of months in the
dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" 
over the entire period, the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period, and the greatest decrease in losses 
(date and amount) over the entire period.

## PyPoll Challenge
here, we've been tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.
We have been given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. 
we have created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following; The total number of votes cast, A complete list 
of candidates who received votes, The percentage of votes each candidate won, The total number of votes each candidate won, The winner of the 
election based on popular vote.
